## Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)

* Allow users to log into their own account and keep lists of frequently attended meetings and locations, keep track of sober time, search for more meetings, find resources and more. One little app to fully track recovery.
#
## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

* Account log-in
* Create lists of meetings with information on ways to attend
* Find resources for books and articles
#
## What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

* C#
* Looking for an API for meetings and times
* .NET
* MySQL
* HTML
* Entity 6
#

## If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

* Integrate API to find meetings in real time
*  Add alerts to notify you when a meeting is about to start
#

## What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

 * ASP.NET 
 * Rest API
 * Dapper
 * Swagger
#

## Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

* As this is a work in progress, I may find more items to add to all of these lists.
