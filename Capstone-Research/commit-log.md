```
bundle.js:95019 Warning: Received `true` for a non-boolean attribute `item`.

If you want to write it to the DOM, pass a string instead: item="true" or item={value.toString()}.
```

*And*

```
bundle.js:95019 Warning: Received `false` for a non-boolean attribute `xs`.

If you want to write it to the DOM, pass a string instead: xs="false" or xs={value.toString()}.

If you used to conditionally omit it with xs={condition && value}, pass xs={condition ? value : undefined} instead.
```
*AND*

```
You are loading @emotion/react when it is already loaded. Running multiple instances may cause problems. This can happen if multiple versions are used, or if multiple builds of the same version are used.
```

*because WHY NOT?*

* ERROR 'firebase' is not defined, 'firebaseConfig' is not defined  no-undef. WHERE??
* Uncaught FirebaseError: Firebase: Error (auth/invalid-api-key).
