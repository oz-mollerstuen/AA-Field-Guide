Good Morning,

My name is Lucas and I've been using your App for a couple of years now and I love it.

This message is in regards to my Capstone project for school, I am writing a program for AA members to keep logs of progress and contacts, find resources, and find meetings(hopefully). There aren't any APIs for finding meetings in realtime that I can find, but I was wondering if you guys had an API (for C#) that I could use for this project. I know that's a big ask, as I can't find an API or documentation on your website, but this is really important to me. 

I hope to hear back to you soon,

Lucas

Hello Lucas,
Your program sounds interesting but I do not believe we will be able to supply you with the API connection that you are looking for.
Alcoholics Anonymous owns and supports an app that gives real time information. It is called Meeting Guide and can be found in your APP Store.
Offices across the country feed data to the app. Because there are various entities that scrap our data and use it to sell their treatment programs, I think you will understand why we don't grant access to our software. You are welcome to link to our website www.pdxaa.org and point to the Find A Meeting feature.
If I am misunderstanding your request please let me know so we can better serve you.
Good luck with your capstone!

Thank you, Mr. Biggers,

I completely understand the reasons why you have reservations about the API, and I already have the meeting guide, as well as many other resources. The reason for the API request is to help users track and add meetings to the calendar and keep a personal inventory on meetings they like/don't like or to keep notes on speakers/subjects and have the ability to have a "favorites" list for meetings with alerts when a meeting is upcoming that they have on said list. Essentially a "Field Guide" for AA. Having the API would be only to be able to scrub meetings so they can view times, locations, and online meeting links much like the App but with extra functionality. 

Thank you, 
Lucas

It sounds like you would be an asset on the app development team.
Would you like me to provide you with an email to speak with a team member?
Possibly they can give what you need to finish your Capstone?
Let me know,
Garry

It is simply, appsupport@aa.org
Good luck!

# Emails to appsupport:

Good afternoon,

My name is Lucas, a friend of Bill, and happily sober. I've been in contact with quite a few people, including Garry Biggers here in Portland, in AA looking for an API to get information such as getting real time information on meetings and times.

This C# site is for personal use for my final project/capstone project for Epicodus in Portland, OR, but many in my homegroup would like to use it as well. This website would be a "Field Guide" to AA of sorts including calendars, meeting alerts, lists of favorite meets and where they are located, resources, and so much more. It's a project that I'm very excited to build and use, and I think that it would be really helpful to newcomers and old cats as well. 

Thank you in advance,

Lucas.
