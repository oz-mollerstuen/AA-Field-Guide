Good Morning,

My name is Lucas and I've been using your App for a couple of years now and I love it.

This message is in regards to my Capstone project for school, I am writing a program for AA members to keep logs of progress and contacts, find resources, and find meetings(hopefully). There aren't any APIs for finding meetings in realtime that I can find, but I was wondering if you guys had an API (for C#) that I could use for this project. I know that's a big ask, as I can't find an API or documentation on your website, but this is really important to me. 

I hope to hear back to you soon,

Lucas
